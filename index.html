    <h1> ü•ê Croissant</h1>
    <p>
        A croissant is a buttery, flaky, Austrian viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the Austrian kipferl but
        using
        the French yeast-leavened laminated dough.[1][better source needed] Croissants are named for their historical
        crescent
        shape, the dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin
        sheet,
        in a technique called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.
